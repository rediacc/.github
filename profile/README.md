# Rediacc

**Infrastructure Automation Platform for Accelerated DevOps**

We're building the future of infrastructure operations‚Äîwhere environments spin up in minutes, disaster recovery is continuous and lightweight, and AI can safely experiment with production-like infrastructure.

## üöÄ What We Do

### Instant Environment Provisioning
Transform environment setup from days to minutes. Create production-like testing environments on demand, enabling rapid development cycles without infrastructure bottlenecks.

### Next-Generation Disaster Recovery
Move beyond traditional backup solutions with continuous, lightweight infrastructure snapshots. Achieve 5X-10X reduction in backup overhead while enabling rapid restoration in minutes, not hours.

### AI-Safe Infrastructure Operations
Built with Model Context Protocol (MCP) support, Rediacc provides safe sandbox environments where AI can experiment, test, and operate on production clones without risk.

## üí° Why Rediacc?

The **Speed Mismatch Crisis**: Modern development teams move fast, but traditional infrastructure workflows don't. Provisioning environments, testing changes, and recovering from failures are still measured in days, not minutes.

Rediacc eliminates these bottlenecks with intelligent automation that accelerates every stage of your development operations.
